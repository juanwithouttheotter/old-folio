                <p>Hello! My name Juan Osorio. and I am an aspiring web developer currently enrolled in Northwestern's
                    web development bootcamp. I currently hold a bachelors degree in music education through VanderCook
                    College of Music. For the last five years, I have taught at the elementary level and held various
                    leadership roles at the different schools I've taught. Through this experience I have learned a lot
                    about myself, my work, and the direction in which I want to drive my future.</p>
                <p>After attempting to make my life easier by creating an automated way of producing my lesson plans
                    using excel spreadsheets, I began to looking into web development. Through the suggestions of my
                    partner, who is a software engineer, and a friend, who has gone through the Northwestern Bootcamp, I found myself heavily.
                    Though I was successful at what I call my "Lesson Plan Machine" the end product was not practical,
                    it was severly limited and knew more could be done... just not with excel. Thus, begins my web
                    development journey.</p>
